The "big" task of the Individual Programming Project

In this fully C project I've made an interface that allows adding cities, roads between them
and routes that consist of several roads. (Deletions, expanding and similar functionality is avaible.)

Use of heap in Dijkstra's was not neccessary to score high in performance tests.

Big part of the grade for this project was meeting deadlines, following a good coding style / practice
and making sure there were no bugs, no memory leaks and that all corner cases worked correctly.
